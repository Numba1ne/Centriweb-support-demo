  E'# Welcome to GoHighLevel

GoHighLevel is an all-in-one platform designed for marketing agencies and businesses to manage their customer relationships, automate workflows, and grow their revenue.

## What is GoHighLevel?

GoHighLevel combines multiple tools into a single platform:

- **CRM**: Manage contacts, leads, and opportunities
- **Marketing Automation**: Create workflows and automated campaigns
- **Funnels & Websites**: Build landing pages and sales funnels
- **Calendar Booking**: Schedule appointments seamlessly
- **SMS & Email**: Multi-channel communication
- **Reputation Management**: Collect and manage reviews
- **Reporting**: Track performance and ROI

## Key Concepts

### Sub-Accounts (Locations)

If you''re an agency, each client gets their own "sub-account" or "location". This keeps their data, contacts, and campaigns completely separate.

### Contacts & Pipelines

All your leads and customers are stored as **contacts**. You can organize them into **pipelines** (like "Sales", "Onboarding", "Support") to track their journey.

### Workflows

Workflows are automated sequences triggered by events (like "Contact fills out form"). They can send emails, SMS, create tasks, and more.

## Next Steps

1. **Set up your first sub-account** (if you''re an agency)
2. **Import your contacts** from existing CRM or CSV
3. **Create your first workflow** to automate follow-ups
4. **Build a funnel** to capture leads

  E'# Setting Up Your First Sub-Account

## What is a Sub-Account?

A sub-account (also called a "location") is a separate workspace for each of your clients. Each sub-account has its own:

- Contacts and pipelines
- Funnels and websites
- Calendars and workflows
- Campaigns and automations

## Creating a Sub-Account

1. **Navigate to Sub-Accounts**
   - Click "Sub-Accounts" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Add Sub-Account"

2. **Enter Basic Information**
   - Business Name
   - Industry (helps with templates)
   - Address and timezone

3. **Choose a Template**
   - Select a pre-built template (e.g., "Real Estate", "Dental Practice")
   - Or start from scratch

4. **Configure Settings**
   - Set business hours
   - Configure notification preferences
   - Add team members

## Best Practices

- **Use naming conventions**: "Client Name - Location" (e.g., "Acme Corp - Seattle")
- **Set up billing early**: Configure Stripe/payment processor before launching
- **Clone successful setups**: Use "Snapshot" feature to duplicate working configurations

## Snapshot Feature

The Snapshot feature lets you save and restore entire sub-account configurations:

1. Create a "Golden Template" with ideal setup
2. Save as Snapshot
3. Deploy to new sub-accounts in seconds

This saves hours of manual configuration!',

  NULL,
  'guide',
  'contacts-crm',
  'Understanding Contacts & Pipelines',
  'Master the core of GoHighLevel: managing contacts and sales pipelines.',
  E'# Understanding Contacts & Pipelines

## Contacts: Your Customer Database

Every person in your system is a **Contact**. Contacts store:

- **Basic Info**: Name, email, phone, address
- **Custom Fields**: Any data you need (industry, budget, etc.)
- **Tags**: Organize contacts into groups
- **Activity History**: All interactions (emails, calls, notes)
- **Pipeline Status**: Where they are in your sales process

## Pipelines: Visualize Your Sales Process

A **Pipeline** represents the stages a contact goes through:

**Example Sales Pipeline:**
1. New Lead
2. Contacted
3. Qualified
4. Proposal Sent
5. Closed Won / Lost

## Creating a Pipeline

1. Go to **Settings → Pipelines**
2. Click **Add Pipeline**
3. Name it (e.g., "Sales", "Onboarding")
4. Add stages with drag-and-drop
5. Configure automation for each stage

## Moving Contacts Through Stages

**Manual:**
- Drag contact cards between stages
- Or click contact → Change Stage

**Automated:**
- Workflows can move contacts automatically
- Based on actions (form fill, email reply, etc.)

## Pipeline Actions

Each stage can trigger:
- Send email/SMS
- Create task for team member
- Start a workflow
- Update contact fields
- Send webhook

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple**: 4-7 stages is ideal
- **Define clear criteria**: What qualifies a lead to move forward?
- **Automate transitions**: Reduce manual work
- **Review weekly**: Look for bottlenecks',

  'Step-by-step guide to creating powerful automation workflows.',
  E'# Building Your First Workflow

## What is a Workflow?

A **Workflow** is an automated sequence of actions triggered by an event. Think of it as "if this happens, do that".

**Example:**
- **Trigger**: Contact fills out "Demo Request" form
- **Actions**:
  1. Send confirmation email
  2. Notify sales team
  3. Add to "New Leads" pipeline
  4. Schedule follow-up task

## Creating a Workflow

### Step 1: Choose a Trigger

Go to **Automation → Workflows → Create Workflow**

Common triggers:
- **Form Submitted**: Contact fills out a specific form
- **Tag Added**: Contact gets a specific tag
- **Pipeline Stage Changed**: Contact moves to a stage
- **Appointment Booked**: Calendar booking created
- **Custom Webhook**: External system sends data

### Step 2: Add Actions

Click **+** to add actions:

**Communication:**
- Send Email
- Send SMS
- Make Phone Call (with Twilio)

**Organization:**
- Add/Remove Tags
- Update Custom Fields
- Move to Pipeline Stage
- Create Task/Appointment

**Logic:**
- Wait (delay next action)
- If/Else Conditions
- Go To (jump to another step)

## Workflow Best Practices

### Use Wait Steps Wisely

Don''t overwhelm contacts with instant messages. Add natural delays:

```
1. Send welcome email
2. Wait 1 day
3. Send "Getting Started" guide
4. Wait 3 days
5. Send "Need help?" check-in
```

### Add Conditions for Personalization

Use **If/Else** to branch based on contact data:

```
IF contact.industry = "Real Estate"
  → Send real estate case study
ELSE IF contact.industry = "Dental"
  → Send dental case study
ELSE
  → Send generic case study
```

## Common Workflow Examples

### Lead Nurture Sequence
1. Contact added to "Cold Leads"
2. Send intro email immediately
3. Wait 2 days → Send value content
4. Wait 3 days → Send case study
5. Wait 5 days → Send demo offer

### Appointment Reminder
1. Appointment booked
2. Send confirmation SMS
3. Wait until 24 hours before → Send reminder email
4. Wait until 1 hour before → Send reminder SMS',

  E'# Setting Up Calendar Booking

## Why Use GoHighLevel Calendars?

Built-in calendar booking eliminates the back-and-forth:
- Clients book when convenient for them
- Automatic confirmations and reminders
- Syncs with Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
- Reduces no-shows with SMS reminders

## Creating a Calendar

1. **Navigate to Calendars**
   - Go to **Settings → Calendars**
   - Click **Add Calendar**

2. **Basic Setup**
   - **Name**: "Initial Consultation", "Sales Call", etc.
   - **Duration**: 15, 30, 60 minutes
   - **Location**: Phone, Zoom, Office address

3. **Availability**
   - Set business hours (e.g., Mon-Fri 9am-5pm)
   - Block lunch breaks or personal time
   - Set buffer time between meetings (5-15 min)

4. **Connect Your Calendar**
   - Link Google Calendar or Outlook
   - GoHighLevel will check for conflicts
   - Two-way sync keeps everything updated

## Advanced Configuration

### Meeting Types

Create different calendars for different purposes:
- **Discovery Call** (15 min, free)
- **Strategy Session** (60 min, paid)
- **Emergency Support** (30 min, existing clients only)

### Qualifying Questions

Add custom questions to booking form:
- "What''s your biggest challenge?"
- "What''s your budget range?"
- "How did you hear about us?"

This pre-qualifies leads before the call!

### Payment Integration

Charge for appointments:
1. Enable **Require Payment**
2. Connect Stripe account
3. Set price ($97, $197, etc.)
4. Payment required before booking confirmed

## Embedding Your Calendar

### Option 1: Direct Link
Share: `https://yourdomain.com/widget/bookings/calendar-id`

### Option 2: Embed in Website
```html
<iframe src="https://yourdomain.com/widget/bookings/calendar-id"
        width="100%" height="800px" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

### Option 3: Add to Funnel
Use Calendar widget in GoHighLevel funnels

## Reducing No-Shows

### Confirmation & Reminders
1. **Immediate**: Confirmation email + SMS
2. **24 hours before**: Reminder email
3. **1 hour before**: Reminder SMS

### Require Confirmation
Ask them to reply "YES" to confirm 24 hours prior

### Use Zoom for Remote Calls
Auto-generate Zoom links → Less friction

## Best Practices

- **Buffer time**: 10-15 min between calls prevents overlaps
- **Limit daily bookings**: Avoid burnout (max 6-8 calls/day)
- **Reschedule policy**: Allow 24-hour cancellation window
- **Follow-up workflow**: Automatically send recap email after call',
